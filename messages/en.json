        "p1": "Since its beginnings in 2012, South Entertainment Group (SEG) has been dedicated to developing innovative technologies for the creation of surfing wave pools. Combining love and innovation for the surf, our journey began with the introduction of a static wave technology in Argentina in 2013; marking our first step towards revolutionizing surfing-related entertainment in pools.",
        "p2": "Our goal was always beyond simply offering a new form of entertainment; determined to recreate the authentic sensation of surfing in the sea, we identified compressed air as the dynamic solution we were looking for. Between 2014 and 2021, we dedicated ourselves to the development of our own propulsion system. That period was marked by intense research and development, which included the construction of prototypes, a full-scale part of the machine and the obtaining of our first patent at the INPI of Argentina. Despite the success and dynamism provided by this system, we faced challenges related to the high costs of implementation, maintenance and energy consumption; These obstacles led us to seek more sustainable and innovative solutions.",
        "p3": "Focused on innovation and reducing environmental impact, we developed a truly eco-friendly surf wave generating system. Our goal is to minimize infrastructure and machinery, using a 100% natural water filtration method, providing a highly competitive implementation and operation cost.",
        "p4": "In 2023, we reached a significant milestone by registering our first patent at the INPI of Brazil with our Waveseg® technology.",
